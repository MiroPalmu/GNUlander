Guilander is library under construction aiming to be
type-safer and more convinient replacement for libwayland to build client applications.

It encodes Wayland protocol to C++ type system by generating C++ headers from protocol XML,
in which Wayland interfaces and messages are represented by types, built form set of primitives.
Communication using the Wayland wire format is implemented
using bleeding edge C++ compile time techniques based on the generated types.
